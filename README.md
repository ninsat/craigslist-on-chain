## Getting Started

If you're comfortable getting up and running from a `git clone`, this method is for you.

If you clone the GitHub repository, you will need to build a number of assets using grunt.

#### Quickstart:

1. `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`
1. `npm install`
1. `grunt build`
1. `grunt start`

Optionally, you may simply run `./make.sh` if you are on a linux or mac based operating system.
